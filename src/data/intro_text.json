We wanted to make data available on Connecticut's communities—particularly data on health risk factors, access and barriers to healthcare, and vulnerable populations—to help with figuring out the next steps as we all respond to this health crisis. None of the data here were newly collected in response to the pandemic.\n\nBecause of this rush, while the data shown are accurate, the online interface may have bugs and may not work well on older browsers. We will continue to add more data over the coming days. Feel free to contact DataHaven with any questions."}
